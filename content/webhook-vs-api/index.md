**APIs** and **webhooks** are two common ways apps communicate with each other.

Before we get into what they are, how they differ, and how they're used, here's a simple way to understand them:

Image you want to grab coffee with your extremely busy friend. 

1. An **API** is like repeatedly texting your friend to see when they're available for coffee. They may say they are unavailable but you keep checking just in case. üì± -- **You initiate the interaction.**

2. A **webhook** is like your friend texting you when they're actually free to grab coffee. You don't have to keep checking. They will let you know when they are free. All you have to do is give them your number (so they know what to use to call you back) üëã -- **Your friend decides when to notify you.**

## What Is An API: How They Work and How To Set Them Up üåâ

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. It is a set of protocols that allow a **connection** between applications, systems, and devices to happen so they can exchange data.  

### Common API Protocols
Here are a few common API protocols you have likely heard about: 
#### REST (Representational State Transfer)
- This is the **most popular** API protocol. 
- Uses **HTTP methods** like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Follows a **stateless architecture**, meaning each request is independent and carries all the necessary information.

#### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- A protocol designed for **exchanging structured information**.
- Uses **XML** for requests and responses.
- Known for its **strong security features** and reliability in enterprise systems.

#### GraphQL (Graph query language)
- Developed by Facebook for **flexible data fetching**.
- Allows clients to request only the data they need, **reducing over-fetching**.
- Uses a **single endpoint** for all queries and mutations.

#### gRPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- Developed by Google for **high-performance communication**.
- Uses HTTP/2 for **faster data transmission**.
- Ideal for **real-time applications and microservices**.

#### WebSocket
- Allows data to flow back and forth between client and server at the same time.
- Commonly used for **live updates like chat apps or real-time notifications**.

| Protocol      | Best For                        | Data Format   | Key Strengths                   |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **REST**         | Simple data requests              | JSON, XML         | Easy to use and widely supported |
| **SOAP**         | Secure transactions (e.g., banking) | XML                 | Strong security features           |
| **GraphQL**      | Precise data fetching              | JSON                 | Flexible data queries               |
| **gRPC**         | Fast communication in microservices | Protobuf           | Efficient for large-scale apps       |
| **WebSocket**    | Real-time updates                  | JSON, Binary        | Ideal for live interactions         |

### How APIs Generally Work

It's important to note that APIs are a **two way communication**. What this means is that you have two parties, one making a request and another one receiving that request, and subsequently choosing what to do with the request before sending back a response. 

These two parties are the **API client** and the **API server**. 

#### API Client
The API client starts the exchange by sending the request to the API server. For example, a user may start a request by entering a search term, like looking up a book title to see more information about it. 

#### API Server
The API server is responsible for handling authentication, validating inputs, and getting and manipulating data. 

```pgsql
API Client                API Server
    |                          |
    | 1. Send request          |
    |    (e.g., search term)   |
    |------------------------->|
    |                          |
    |                          | 2. Request is processed 
    |                          |
    |                          | 3. Server processes data
    |<-------------------------|
    | 4. Response is sent      |
    |    - Status code         |
    |       (e.g., 200 OK)     |
    |    - Headers             |
    |       (e.g.,Content-Type)|
    |    - Body                |
    |       (e.g., data)       |
    |                          |

```

There are two other components at play here, the **API request** and the **API response**. <br> **The API request is the request the API client makes.** <br> **The API response is what the API server sends back.**

#### API request 
An API request usually includes:

- **Endpoint**: The URL that targets a specific resource (e.g., /books).
- **Method**: Defines the action (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Parameters**: Extra details passed to customize the request (e.g., a "topic" filter).
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs that provide extra info like content type or authentication.
- **Body**: Contains data for creating, updating, or deleting a resource (e.g., book content).

#### API response 
An API response usually includes:

- **Status Code**: A three-digit code that shows the result (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found).
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs with extra details about the response.
- **Body**: The actual data or an error message if something went wrong.

### APIs in the Real World

Let's cement this information by seeing how different apps allow you to use their APIs.

#### üìã How Trello Uses APIs
Trello offers an API that allows developers to interact with Trello boards, cards, and lists programmatically.
- With the Trello API, you can create, update, and delete cards, boards, and lists.
- Unlike webhooks (which only receive data), APIs let your app both send and request information from Trello.
- This is useful for automating task creation, syncing data with other tools, or building custom Trello features.

An example of how you can create a new card called **New Feature Request** in a specific list, using the Trello API: 

```javascript 
fetch("https://api.trello.com/1/cards", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "New Feature Request",
    desc: "User requested a dark mode feature.",
    idList: "60d5b2cd8a1234567890abcd",  // The ID of the Trello list where the card should be added
    key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    token: "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
  })
});
```

1. This request tells Trello, "Create a new card called 'New Feature Request' in the specified list."
2. The Trello API processes the request and adds the card.
3. The key and token authenticate your request, ensuring only authorized apps can make changes.

#### üåê How Slack Uses APIs
Slack offers a powerful API that developers can use to build custom integrations, automate tasks, and interact with Slack data.
- With the Slack API, you can send messages, retrieve channel history, manage users, and more.
- Unlike webhooks (which only receive data), APIs let your app both send and request information from Slack.
- This is useful for building chatbots, scheduling messages, or fetching data from Slack for reports.

An example of how you can send a new message on Slack using the Slack API instead of going on the app and typing it out in their UI. 

```javascript 
fetch("https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer xoxb-1234567890-0987654321-abcdef"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    channel: "#general",
    text: "Hello, team! üëã",
    username: "BotBuddy"
  })
});
```

1. This request tells Slack, "Post a message saying 'Hello, team! üëã' in the #general channel."
2. Slack's API processes the request and posts the message.
3. The Authorization header includes your Slack token, which authenticates the request.

## What Is A Webhook: How They Work and How To Set Them Up üì©

**A webhook is an event driven communication between apps.** This means that a webhook sends data to another app when something happens, which is programmed to trigger it. 
This communication happens through HTTP. 

For example, imagine you‚Äôre using a payment app. When a customer makes a payment, the app can automatically send a webhook to your server with details about the payment, like the amount and the customer‚Äôs name. Your server doesn‚Äôt have to keep asking the payment app for updates. It just gets notified when something important happens.

### How Webhooks Generally Work
Creating a webhook involves setting up a system where one application automatically sends data to another when a specific event happens. Here is a simple step-by-step overview:

#### Choose the Event to Trigger the Webhook
- Decide what event should trigger the webhook.
- Example: A new user signs up, a payment is made, or an issue is created in a project management tool like GitHub. 

#### Set Up the Webhook Endpoint (Receiver)
- Create a URL (an API endpoint) in the destination system to receive the webhook request.  
- This is usually a REST API that listens for incoming data. 
- Example: A server with a route like `https://yourapp.com/webhook`.

#### Configure the Webhook in the Source System 
- In the source system (where the event happens), configure the webhook by providing: 
    - The destination URL (your webhook endpoint).
    - The type of event it should listen for. 
    - Authentication details if needed. 

#### Send Data When the Event Occurs
- When the event happens, the source systems sends an HTTP request (usually a `POST` request) to the destination URL with relevant data in JSON format.
- Example payload: 
```json
{
    "event": "user_signed_up",
    "user": {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "John Snow",
        "email": "johnsnow@winteriscoming.com"
    }
}
```

#### Process the Webhook in the Destination System
- The destination system receives the webhook request. 
- It validates the request, extracts the data, and processes it (e.g., storing it in a database or triggering another action).
- It usually sends back a `200 OK` response to confirm it received the webhook.

#### Handles Errors and Retries 
- If the webhook fails (the destination server is down), the source system may retry sending the request after some time. 

```pgsql 
   Event Source                   Destination Server
      |                                 |
      | 1. Event occurs (e.g., new user signup)
      |                                 |
      | 2. Webhook automatically ------>|
      |    sends data                   |
      |                                 |
```

### Webhooks in the Real World

Let's cement this information by seeing how different apps allow you to use webhooks. 

#### üìù How Trello Uses Webhooks 
[**Trello**](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/webhooks/) is an app for managing tasks.
Instead of constantly checking Trello for updates (like new cards, changes to boards, etc.), webhooks let Trello notify your app only when something important happens.
- Normally, your app would need to repeatedly ask Trello for updates, which wastes time and resources.
- Instead, Trello lets you set up a webhook ‚Äî a special URL that your app provides.
- When something changes (like a new card is added or a board is updated), Trello automatically sends a message to your webhook URL with the details.
**This makes your app more efficient since it only gets data when there‚Äôs something new to know.**

```javascript
$.post("https://api.trello.com/1/tokens/{APIToken}/webhooks/?key={APIKey}", {
  description: "My first webhook",   // A short description for your webhook
  callbackURL: "http://www.mywebsite.com/trelloCallback",  // Your webhook endpoint (where Trello will send data)
  idModel: "4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c",  // The ID of the Trello board, list, or card you want to track
});
```
1. This request tells Trello, *"Watch this specific Trello board (or list/card) with ID 4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c."*
2. Trello then sends updates to the provided `callbackURL` whenever something changes.
3. Your webhook endpoint (e.g., `/trelloCallback`) should be set up to handle these incoming updates.

#### üí¨ How Slack Uses Webhooks 
[**Slack**](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks) is a popular messaging platform for teams.
Instead of building a full integration, webhooks let your app send messages to Slack channels directly.
- Normally, sending messages to Slack would require complex API requests.
- Instead, Slack provides incoming webhooks ‚Äî special URLs that your app can use to send messages with a simple HTTP request.
- By sending data to this URL, you can post messages, alerts, or updates in Slack channels automatically.
**This makes it easy to notify Slack channels about important events without extra complexity.**

```javascript
fetch("https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "New order received! üéâ",
    username: "OrderBot",
    icon_emoji: ":package:"
  })
});
```
1. This request tells Slack, *"Post a message saying 'New order received! üéâ' in the channel linked to this webhook URL."*
2. Slack then displays the message in the specified channel.
3. You can customize the message text, username, and even add emojis or attachments.


## ‚ú® Key Differences Between APIs and Webhooks: Summarized ‚ú®

An important distinction between **webhooks** and **APIs** is understanding **who initiates the communication** and **how they interact**. Let's break it down.

### APIs
- An API is a set of rules that allows one app to request data or functionality from another app.
- The **client** sends a request (example, `GET /data`) to the server, and the server responds with the data. 
- **The client is in control** -- it decides when to ask for the information.

> The client requests data, and the server responds.

### Webhooks
- A webhook is not something you actively call like an API. It's a mechanism where the server sends data to the client as soon as something happens. 
- The **client** provides the server with a URL (endpoint), and the server "calls back" to the URL when the data is ready. 
- **The server is in control** -- it decides when to send data. 

> The server pushes data without the client asking for it.



| Aspect               | API  üåâ                                        | Webhook   üì©                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Request Initiation** | The client actively requests data from the server. | The server automatically sends data when an event occurs. |
| **Time**               | The client decides when to make a request (on-demand). | The request happens automatically when triggered by an event. |
| **Communication Model** | Request-response model (the client asks, the server responds). | Event-driven model (the server pushes data to the client). |
| **Efficiency**         | Can be inefficient if polling frequently to check for updates. | More efficient because updates are sent only when necessary. |
| **Use Case Examples**  | Fetching user details, submitting a form, processing payments. | Getting notified when a payment is completed, a new user signs up, or a file is uploaded. |
| **Reliability & Error Handling** | If a request fails, the client can retry instantly. | If the destination server is down, the webhook might be lost unless retries are built in. |
| **Security**           | Typically secured with API keys, OAuth, or JWT authentication. | Often secured using secret tokens or HMAC signatures to verify authenticity. |
| **Analogy**            | Repeatedly asking the barista if the coffee is ready, until it is | The barista letting you know when your coffee is actually ready |


- **Webhooks**: Ideal for real-time data transfer, enabling immediate reactions to events and notifications.
- **APIs**: Best for on-demand data retrieval and updates.
