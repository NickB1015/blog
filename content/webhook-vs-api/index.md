Typically there are two ways apps communicate with each other: **polling** and **webhooks**. 

**Polling** is like knocking on your neighbor's door and asking if they have sugar (information), but you have to go and ask for it every time you want it. 

**Webhooks** are like someone tossing a bag of sugar at your house whenever they buy some. You don't have to ask, they just automatically give it to you when they have some. 

Webhooks are almost always faster than polling and require less work to set up on your end. 

Webhooks are similar to APIs but simpler. An API is a full language for an app with functions or calls to add, edit, and retrieve data. The difference 

## What Is An API? ðŸŒ‰

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is designed to carry out an action. It's like a bridge that lets different systems talk to each other. It defines the rules for how one system can ask another for information or services and explains the kind of responses to expect. This makes it easier for apps, services, or programs to work together.

APIs are a two way communication. They can handle large volumes of data, more intricate communication between devices, and more complicated functions. 

They are like a layer of software between the app and a web server. Someone uses the app that will request data from the server, like loading a set of images. That triggers the API, and it handles communication as needed for whatever you are doing. 

APIs can support more advanced security protocols. They have a higher capability of security. It doesn't mean that all APIs are more secure, or that webhooks are not secure. 

- An **API** lets clients request data whenever they need it (unlike webhooks, which push data automatically).
- **Common uses**: Fetching data, submitting forms, processing payments, etc.
- **Best practices**: Use authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.

### How APIs Generally Work
An **API** allows one system to request data or perform actions in another system. Unlike webhooks, APIs require the client to make a request to get a response. Hereâ€™s how you set one up:

#### Define What Your API Will Do 
Decide what functionality your API should provide. This includes:

- What data it will send or receive (e.g., user info, orders, messages).
- What actions it will allow (e.g., creating, updating, deleting records).
- **Example**: A User API that allows clients to get user details and create new users.

#### Set Up a Server to Handle API Requests
- Create a server that listens to API requests. This server will process requests and return responses. 

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); 

const users = [{ id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' }];

// GET endpoint to retrieve users
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json(users);
});

// POST endpoint to create a new user
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
    const newUser = { id: users.length + 1, ...req.body };
    users.push(newUser);
    res.status(201).json(newUser);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API running on port 3000'));
```

#### Call the API (Client Side)
A client (another system, app, or frontend) makes requests to the API using HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`.

#### Handle Authentication
To secure your API, you can require authentication (e.g., API keys, JWT tokens).

```pgsql 
    Client                      Server
      |                            |
      | 1. Request data  --------->|
      |                            |
      |<--------- 2. Response data |
      |                            |
```

## What Is A Webhook? ðŸ“©

When I was seven years old, I had the annoying habit of asking my dad "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" on drives. All the time. He kept responding with "No,we're not." After a few minutes, which to me must have felt like hours, I would once again ask, "Are we there yet?" ðŸš— After a while he would respond with "I will tell you when we get there."

[write something that would come here to soft launch us into webhooks]

A **webhook** is like a notification system between two apps. When something happens in one app (the source), it automatically sends an HTTP request to another app (the destination) to let it know about the event and share some related data.

For example, imagine youâ€™re using a payment app. When a customer makes a payment, the app can automatically send a webhook to your server with details about the payment, like the amount and the customerâ€™s name. Your server doesnâ€™t have to keep asking the payment app for updatesâ€”it just gets notified when something important happens.

### How Webhooks Generally Work
Creating a webhook involves setting up a system where one application automatically sends data to another when a specific event happens. Here is a simple step-by-step overview:

#### Choose the Event to Trigger the Webhook
- Decide what event should trigger the webhook.
- Example: A new user signs up, a payment is made, or an issue is created in a project management tool like GitHub. 

#### Set Up the Webhook Endpoint (Receiver)
- Create a URL (an API endpoint) in the destination system to receive the webhook request.  
- This is usually a REST API that listens for incoming data. 
- Example: A server with a route like `https://yourapp.com/webhook`.

#### Configure the Webhook in the Source System 
- In the source system (where the event happens), configure the webhook by providing: 
    - The destination URL (your webhook endpoint).
    - The type of event it should listen for. 
    - Authentication details if needed. 

#### Send Data When the Event Occurs
- When the event happens, the source systems sends an HTTP request (usually a `POST` request) to the destination URL with relevant data in JSON format.
- Example payload: 
```json
{
    "event": "user_signed_up",
    "user": {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "John Snow",
        "email": "johnsnow@winteriscoming.com"
    }
}
```

#### Process the Webhook in the Destination System
- The destination system receives the webhook request. 
- It validates the request, extracts the data, and processes it (e.g., storing it in a database or triggering another action).
- It usually sends back a `200 OK` response to confirm it received the webhook.

#### Handles Errors and Retries 
- If the webhook fails (the destination server is down), the source system may retry sending the request after some time. 

```pgsql 
   Event Source                   Destination Server
      |                                 |
      | 1. Event occurs (e.g., new user signup)
      |                                 |
      | 2. Webhook automatically ------>|
      |    sends data                   |
      |                                 |
```

## Key Differences Between APIs and Webhooks
### Request Initiation: 
- **API**: The client actively requests data from the server.
- **Webhook**: The server automatically sends data when an event occurs.

### Time
- **API**: The client decides when to make a request (on-demand).
- **Webhook**: The request happens automatically when triggered by an event.

### Communication Model: 
- **API**: Request-response model (the client asks, the server responds).
- **Webhook**: Event-driven model (the server pushes data to the client).

### Efficiency 
- **API**: Can be inefficient if polling frequently to check for updates.
- **Webhook**: More efficient because updates are sent only when necessary.

### Use Case Examples
- **API**: Fetching user details, submitting a form, processing payments.
- **Webhook**: Getting notified when a payment is completed, a new user signs up, or a file is uploaded.

### Reliability & Error Handling:

- **API**: If a request fails, the client can retry instantly.
- **Webhook**: If the destination server is down, the webhook might be lost unless retries are built in.

### Security 
- **API**: Typically secured with API keys, OAuth, or JWT authentication.
- **Webhook**: Often secured using secret tokens or HMAC signatures to verify authenticity.

### Analogy
- **API**: Calling a restaurant to ask for their menu.
- **Webhook**: The restaurant calls you when your order is ready.
