**APIs** and **webhooks** are two common ways apps communicate with each other.

Before we get into what they are, how they differ, and how they're used, here's a simple way to understand them:

Image you want to grab coffee with your extremely busy friend. 

1. An **API** is like repeatedly texting your friend to see when they're available for coffee. 📱

2. A **webhook** is like your friend texting you when they're free to grab coffee. 👋

## What Is An API? 🌉

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. It is a set of protocols that allow a **connection** between applications, systems, and devices to happen so they can exchange data.  

### Common API Protocols
Here are a few common API protocols you have likely heard about: 
#### REST (Representational State Transfer)
- This is the **most popular** API protocol. 
- Uses **HTTP methods** like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Follows a **stateless architecture**, meaning each request is independent and carries all the necessary information.

#### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- A protocol designed for **exchanging structured information**.
- Uses **XML** for requests and responses.
- Known for its **strong security features** and reliability in enterprise systems.

#### GraphQL (Graph query language)
- Developed by Facebook for **flexible data fetching**.
- Allows clients to request only the data they need, **reducing over-fetching**.
- Uses a **single endpoint** for all queries and mutations.

#### gRPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- Developed by Google for **high-performance communication**.
- Uses HTTP/2 for **faster data transmission**.
- Ideal for **real-time applications and microservices**.

#### WebSocket
- Allows data to flow back and forth between client and server at the same time.
- Commonly used for **live updates like chat apps or real-time notifications**.

| Protocol      | Best For                        | Data Format   | Key Strengths                   |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **REST**         | Simple data requests              | JSON, XML         | Easy to use and widely supported |
| **SOAP**         | Secure transactions (e.g., banking) | XML                 | Strong security features           |
| **GraphQL**      | Precise data fetching              | JSON                 | Flexible data queries               |
| **gRPC**         | Fast communication in microservices | Protobuf           | Efficient for large-scale apps       |
| **WebSocket**    | Real-time updates                  | JSON, Binary        | Ideal for live interactions         |

### How Do APIs Work? 

It's important to note that APIs are a **two way communication**. What this means is that you have two parties, one making a request and another one receiving that request, and subsequently choosing what to do with the request before sending back a response. 

These two parties are the **API client** and the **API server**. 

#### API Client
The API client starts the exchange by sending the request to the API server. For example, a user may start a request by entering a search term, like looking up a book title to see more information about it. 

#### API Server
The API server is responsible for handling authentication, validating inputs, and getting and manipulating data. 

```pgsql
API Client                API Server
    |                          |
    | 1. Send request          |
    |    (e.g., search term)   |
    |------------------------->|
    |                          |
    |                          | 2. Request is processed 
    |                          |
    |                          | 3. Server processes data
    |<-------------------------|
    | 4. Response is sent      |
    |    - Status code         |
    |       (e.g., 200 OK)     |
    |    - Headers             |
    |       (e.g.,Content-Type)|
    |    - Body                |
    |       (e.g., data)       |
    |                          |

```

There are two other components at play here, the **API request** and the **API response**. <br> **The API request is the request the API client makes.** <br> **The API response is what the API server sends back.**

#### API request 
An API request usually includes:

- **Endpoint**: The URL that targets a specific resource (e.g., /books).
- **Method**: Defines the action (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Parameters**: Extra details passed to customize the request (e.g., a "topic" filter).
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs that provide extra info like content type or authentication.
- **Body**: Contains data for creating, updating, or deleting a resource (e.g., book content).

#### API response 
An API response usually includes:

- **Status Code**: A three-digit code that shows the result (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found).
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs with extra details about the response.
- **Body**: The actual data or an error message if something went wrong.

## What Is A Webhook? 📩

A **webhook** an event driven communication between apps. When something happens in one app (the source), it automatically sends an HTTP request to another app (the destination) to let it know about the event and share some related data.

For example, imagine you’re using a payment app. When a customer makes a payment, the app can automatically send a webhook to your server with details about the payment, like the amount and the customer’s name. Your server doesn’t have to keep asking the payment app for updates. It just gets notified when something important happens.

### How Webhooks Generally Work
Creating a webhook involves setting up a system where one application automatically sends data to another when a specific event happens. Here is a simple step-by-step overview:

#### Choose the Event to Trigger the Webhook
- Decide what event should trigger the webhook.
- Example: A new user signs up, a payment is made, or an issue is created in a project management tool like GitHub. 

#### Set Up the Webhook Endpoint (Receiver)
- Create a URL (an API endpoint) in the destination system to receive the webhook request.  
- This is usually a REST API that listens for incoming data. 
- Example: A server with a route like `https://yourapp.com/webhook`.

#### Configure the Webhook in the Source System 
- In the source system (where the event happens), configure the webhook by providing: 
    - The destination URL (your webhook endpoint).
    - The type of event it should listen for. 
    - Authentication details if needed. 

#### Send Data When the Event Occurs
- When the event happens, the source systems sends an HTTP request (usually a `POST` request) to the destination URL with relevant data in JSON format.
- Example payload: 
```json
{
    "event": "user_signed_up",
    "user": {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "John Snow",
        "email": "johnsnow@winteriscoming.com"
    }
}
```

#### Process the Webhook in the Destination System
- The destination system receives the webhook request. 
- It validates the request, extracts the data, and processes it (e.g., storing it in a database or triggering another action).
- It usually sends back a `200 OK` response to confirm it received the webhook.

#### Handles Errors and Retries 
- If the webhook fails (the destination server is down), the source system may retry sending the request after some time. 

```pgsql 
   Event Source                   Destination Server
      |                                 |
      | 1. Event occurs (e.g., new user signup)
      |                                 |
      | 2. Webhook automatically ------>|
      |    sends data                   |
      |                                 |
```

## Key Differences Between APIs and Webhooks
| Aspect               | API  🌉                                        | Webhook   📩                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Request Initiation** | The client actively requests data from the server. | The server automatically sends data when an event occurs. |
| **Time**               | The client decides when to make a request (on-demand). | The request happens automatically when triggered by an event. |
| **Communication Model** | Request-response model (the client asks, the server responds). | Event-driven model (the server pushes data to the client). |
| **Efficiency**         | Can be inefficient if polling frequently to check for updates. | More efficient because updates are sent only when necessary. |
| **Use Case Examples**  | Fetching user details, submitting a form, processing payments. | Getting notified when a payment is completed, a new user signs up, or a file is uploaded. |
| **Reliability & Error Handling** | If a request fails, the client can retry instantly. | If the destination server is down, the webhook might be lost unless retries are built in. |
| **Security**           | Typically secured with API keys, OAuth, or JWT authentication. | Often secured using secret tokens or HMAC signatures to verify authenticity. |
| **Analogy**            | Repeatedly asking the barista if the coffee is ready, until it is | The barista letting you know when your coffee is actually ready |
