## What Is An API? 

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is like a bridge that lets different systems talk to each other. It defines the rules for how one system can ask another for information or services and explains the kind of responses to expect. This makes it easier for apps, services, or programs to work together.

## What Is A Webhook? 

**Webhooks** are like automatic notifications sent from one system to another when something happens. The first system *(the provider)* sends a message to a specific URL *(the destination)* set up by the second system. This one-way communication is why webhooks are sometimes called "reverse APIs."
