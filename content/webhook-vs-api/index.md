Typically there are two ways apps communicate with each other: **polling** and **webhooks**. 

**Polling** is like knocking on your neighbor's door and asking if they have sugar (information), but you have to go and ask for it every time you want it. 

**Webhooks** are like someone tossing a bag of sugar at your house whenever they buy some. You don't have to ask, they just automatically give it to you when they have some. 

Webhooks are almost always faster than polling and require less work to set up on your end. 

Webhooks are similar to APIs but simpler. An API is a full language for an app with functions or calls to add, edit, and retrieve data. The difference 

## What Is An API? ðŸŒ‰

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is designed to carry out an action. It's like a bridge that lets different systems talk to each other. It defines the rules for how one system can ask another for information or services and explains the kind of responses to expect. This makes it easier for apps, services, or programs to work together.

APIs are a two way communication. They can handle large volumes of data, more intricate communication between devices, and more complicated functions. 

They are like a layer of software between the app and a web server. Someone uses the app that will request data from the server, like loading a set of images. That triggers the API, and it handles communication as needed for whatever you are doing. 

They can support more advanced security protocols. They have a higher capability of security. It doesn't mean that all APIs are more secure, or that webhooks are not secure. 

## What Is A Webhook? ðŸ“©

When I was seven years old, I had the annoying habit of asking my dad "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" on drives. All the time. He kept responding with "No,we're not." After a few minutes, which to me must have felt like hours, I would once again ask, "Are we there yet?" ðŸš— After a while he would respond with "I will tell you when we get there."

[write something that would come here to soft launch us into webhooks]

A **webhook** is like a notification system between two apps. When something happens in one app (the source), it automatically sends an HTTP request to another app (the destination) to let it know about the event and share some related data.

For example, imagine youâ€™re using a payment app. When a customer makes a payment, the app can automatically send a webhook to your server with details about the payment, like the amount and the customerâ€™s name. Your server doesnâ€™t have to keep asking the payment app for updatesâ€”it just gets notified when something important happens.
