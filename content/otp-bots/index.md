Explore how OTP bots bypass two-factor authentication (2FA), their growing threats, and strategies to protect your application using tools like SuperTokens. ðŸ¦¸ 

So you finally did it! You switched to a Multi-Factor Authentication and you feel secure and on top of the world. But apparently we canâ€™t have nice things for too long because here we are, in a world of OTP bots, leveraging our advanced technology to rudely gain unauthorized access to your usersâ€™ accounts. 

Not to worry because we donâ€™t give up at challenges. Letâ€™s unravel what those bots are and how to fight them. ðŸ¥Š

If you want to skip right to your desired section, or just look at what we will cover, here is our nifty table of contents. ðŸ“œ

## What are OTPs (One-Time Passwords) ðŸ“²

A **One-Time Password (OTP)** is a key part of 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication), adding a second layer of security to traditional password-based logins. ðŸ”‘

OTPs are temporary codes sent via an app, SMS, or email that users enter on a website for extra security. They expire after a short time, ensuring added protection. 

This ensures that even if your password is stolen, your account remains secure with the extra layer of authentication.

For the longest time we have heard that this is the way to keep our passwords secure. More and more apps now are encouraging users to add a second layer of security to their accounts. Itâ€™s not unreasonable to get a false sense of security after installing this second layer of security. 

Sadly we cant have nice things for long because here we are, discussing OTP bots. 

## What Are OTP Bots? ðŸ¤–

**OTP bots** are advanced programs designed to intercept and steal One-Time Passwords (OTPs), allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to protected accounts. These bots cause significant harm to both individuals and businesses.

Their rise coincides with the growing use of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). To understand the risk, hereâ€™s a simple before-and-after comparison:

**Without 2FA:**

Attacker â†’ **Your Password** â†’ Your Account ðŸ’»

In this scenario, stealing your password is all it takes for an attacker to access your account.

**With 2FA (OTP Layer):**

Attacker â†’ Your Password â†’ **Your OTP** â†’ Your Account ðŸ’»
