**When you think about authentication the first thing that comes to mind is most likely a user-to-machine authentication, like logging into a social media or banking app.**

But just as we humans need to log in to get access to privileged data, machines communicate with each other way more often than we do with them. They exchange data constantly as we speak or go about our daily lives. 

But there is another case where machines need to exchange data between each other in what is aptly called **machine-to-machine (M2M) communication**. And as with any digital exchange of data we want to make sure that not everyone can access that data. This is why we authenticate ourselves as people in order to be able to access certain data. But when machines need to access private data, we also need to make sure that they have the right methods of authenticating themselves so that no malicious actors get a hold of important data. 

This is where **machine to machine authentication** comes in, and this article is exploring all the intricacies of machine to machine authentication. 

Let's enter the world of machines. ü§ñ

## What is a Machine? 
In machine-to-machine communication, "machines" is a pretty broad term. It can refer to servers, applications, Internet of Things devices, APIs, or even cronjobs. 

In the context of this article we are going over authentication between services rather than IoT devices like robots or smart house devices. [this may need to go in the introduction of the article actually so the reader can know what to expect]

## Machine-to-Machine Communication
**Simply put, machine-to-machine communication is the automated exchange of information between machines -- no human involvement.** ‚ùåüßë

### Some Examples of M2M Communication: 
- ‚òÅÔ∏è A cloud service retrieving data from a database
- üîÑ An API fetching information from another service 
- üì° Two IoT (Internet of Things) devices synchronizing their status

Unlike human-to-machine communication (*like logging into a website with a username and password* üíª) where the identity of the **human** needs to be verified, M2M communication requires authentication mechanisms that verify the identity of a **machine**.

## Machine-to-Machine Authentication?

Machine-to-Machine authentication is **the process of verifying the identity of a machine** that is trying to communicate with another machine. This is a broad definition that can be broken down further. 

You can have M2M communication and therefore authentication both in hardware and software. 

An cool example of a hardware machine that other machines need to communicate with and authenticate would be the Mars Rover.  

In software we also have a ton of services that constantly communicate with each other and pass on or request data. That data needs to be passed on securely so those machines need to be authenticated to make sure that any sensitive data is not passed to the wrong machine hands. ü¶æ

M2M authentication uses protocols like OAuth 2.0 (Open Protocol) to make sure that authentication is robust and data remains secure. 

This can be done using various methods, like API keys, OAuth tokens, mutual TLS (mTLS), or cryptographic certificates. 

Strong M2M authentication prevents unauthorized access, protects sensitive data, and ensures that only trusted entities can interact within a network. 

| **User Authentication üë§** | **M2M Authentication ü§ñ** |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Requires human interaction (e.g., login form, password) | Fully automated (no human input) |
| Uses username/password or social logins (OAuth Authorization Code Flow) | Uses **client ID and secret** or service accounts |
| Access is tied to a user session | Access is tied to a **machine identity** |
| Example: A user logs into a social media site and gets a session token | Example: A backend service calls an API using a client credentials token |

## M2M authentication vs M2M authorization
Developers often use M2M authentication and M2M authorization interchangeably. Here is a simple explanation of the differences: 
- M2M authentication means **verifying the identity** of the machine. 
- M2M authorization determines **what actions the verified machine is allowed to perform or what data it can access**. 

If you want to read more about the difference between authentication and authorization, you can check out the article, [**Authentication vs Authorization: What's the difference?**](https://supertokens.com/blog/authentication-vs-authorization)

## ‚ú® Deeper Look Into How M2M Authentication Works ‚ú®
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) authentication is a crucial security process that ensures devices can securely exchange data without human involvement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. **Device Identification and Authentication** -- Devices authenticate themselves by presenting a unique Client ID and Secret to an OAuth 2.0 Authorization server. This process verifies the device's identity before granting any permissions.

2. **Access Token Issuance** -- Upon successful authentication, the authorization server issues an Access Token. This token carries specific permissions that allow the device to perform authorized tasks or access designated resources.

3. **Secure Communication** -- Only devices with valid tokens can initiate communication, ensuring that unauthorized entities are blocked. This strengthens data security by reducing the risk of malicious access.

4. **Communication Standards** -- M2M systems often rely on protocols like MQTT, CoAP, and others to optimize data exchange for different use cases. These standards ensure efficient communication even in resource-constrained environments.

5. **Enhanced Security and Efficiency** -- By enforcing strict authentication protocols, M2M communication prevents unauthorized access and ensures that data exchanges remain secure. This method is especially valuable in large-scale systems such as IoT networks and cloud infrastructures.

6. **Autonomous Operations** -- M2M authentication enables devices to perform tasks independently, reducing the need for human oversight and improving operational efficiency in automated environments.


**More notes on step by step on how M2M works:**

Uses the client credentials grant flow 

1. The **Client** authenticates with the **Authorization Server** using its own credentials (the Client ID and Client Secret).
2. The **Authorization Server** verifies the credentials 
3. The **Authorization Server** returns an **OAuth2 Access Token**.
4. The **Client** uses the **OAuth2 Access Token** to access protected resources. 
5. The **Resource Server** validates the **OAuth2 Access Token**. 
6. If the validation is successful, the **Resource Server** returns the requested resource.

## Why Is Machine-to-Machine Authorization Important? üõ°Ô∏è

M2M authorization plays a critical role in ensuring secure and efficient communication between devices. Here's why it's important:

1. **Prevents Unauthorized Access:** By verifying device identities and enforcing token-based access, M2M authorization ensures that only trusted devices can perform specific actions or access resources.

2. **Protects Sensitive Data:** Authorization controls limit data exposure, minimizing the risk of data breaches during machine-to-machine communication.

3. **Enables Scalable Systems:** M2M authorization streamlines device management in large networks, making it easier to handle multiple devices securely.

4. **Ensures Compliance:** Implementing proper authorization mechanisms helps organizations meet security and privacy regulations in sectors like healthcare, finance, and smart infrastructure.

5. **Improves Operational Efficiency:** By enabling devices to authenticate and authorize themselves automatically, M2M authorization reduces manual intervention and simplifies workflows.

Incorporating robust M2M authorization practices is key to securing connected devices and ensuring seamless, secure communication in modern technology ecosystems.

## Common Use Cases for M2M Authentication üìä

M2M authentication is especially useful in scenarios where secure, automated communication between devices is essential. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Service to Service:** Ensures secure communication between microservices or backend systems in distributed applications.

2. **Daemon to Backend:** Enables background processes (daemons) to authenticate securely with backend services for data processing or updates.

3. **CLI Client to Internal Service:** Ensures that command-line tools interacting with internal services are properly authenticated and authorized.

4. **Internet of Things (IoT) Tools:** Provides secure communication for IoT devices, protecting sensitive data transfers and enabling scalable device management.

Implementing M2M authentication in these scenarios helps protect critical systems, prevent unauthorized access, and streamline secure data exchange.

## How to Secure Your Machine Communication With SuperTokens
SuperTokens recommends securing your machine-to-machine communication with **OAuth2 specifications**. You have to create an **OAuth2 Provider** and use the **OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow** for authorization. 

1. **Service A** uses credentials to get an OAuth2 Access Token 
2. Authorization Service returns the OAuth2 Access Token 
3. **Service A** uses the OAuth Access Token to communicate with **Service B**
4. **Service B** validates the OAuth2 Access Token
5. If the token is valid then **Service B** returns the requested resource. 

![SuperTokens' Client Credentials Flow Diagram Between Two Services - Service A and Service B](machine-to-machine.png)

1. Service A reaches out to the SuperTokens Backend SDK to get an OAuth Access Token
2. The SuperTokens Backend SDK responds back to Service A with an OAuth2 Access Token

3. Service A then communicates with Service B using the OAuth Access Token
4. Service B talks to the SuperTokens Core Service to validate the OAuth Access Token 

5. If the OAuth Access Token is valid, then Service B returns the requested resource. 

Before going into the actual instructions, start by imagining a real life example that you can reference along the way. This makes it easier to understand what is happening. We are going to configure authentication for the following setup. 

- Calendar Service that exposes these actions: event.view, event.create, event.update, and event.delete
- A file Service that exposes these actions: file.view, file.create, file.update, and file.delete
- a Task service that interacts with the calendar service and the file service in the process of scheudling a taslk. 

The goal is to allow the task service to perform an authenticated action on the calendar service. Proceed to the actual steps. 

SuperTokens offers machine to machine authentication using the OAUth2 Protocol -- the industry standard for machine to machine authentication. 

## Steps to Implementing M2M Authentication with SuperTokens -- Super Simple to Set Up

‚úÖ SuperTokens makes OAuth2 setup straightforward with its dashboard and API.

‚úÖ Each service should have its own Client ID and Secret for secure authentication.

‚úÖ Tokens ensure services can only perform authorized tasks.

‚úÖ Token validation helps confirm the authenticity and permissions of each request.

### üöÄ Step 1: Enable OAuth2 in SuperTokens Dashboard

In the **SuperTokens Dashboard**, you need to enable the **OAuth2 feature**. This feature allows services (like APIs or background jobs) to authenticate securely without user involvement. Once enabled, you'll see OAuth options in your application settings.

- Go to your **SuperTokens.com Dashboard**.
- Enable the **OAuth2 feature**.
- This unlocks OAuth recipes for your applications.

### üîß Step 2: Create OAuth2 Clients
Each service that needs authentication will need its own OAuth2 client. Think of this like giving each service its own ID badge.

- For each service (e.g., Task Service, Calendar Service), create a unique OAuth2 client.
- Use this code snippet to create a client:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = '<CORE_API_ENDPOINT>';
const API_KEY = '<YOUR_API_KEY>';

const url = `${BASE_URL}/recipe/oauth/clients`;
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'api-key': API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    clientName: "TaskService",
    grantTypes: ["client_credentials"],
    scope: "event.create",
    audience: ["event"],
  })
};

fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
‚úÖ This registers your service so it can request access tokens later.

**Key Details:**
- `"clientName"` identifies the service (e.g., `TaskService`).
- `"grantTypes": ["client_credentials"]` specifies that this client will authenticate using M2M.
- `"scope"` defines the permissions this client will have.


### üèóÔ∏è Step 3: Single App vs Multi App Setup
**Single App Setup:** For one project (e.g., a web app or API) that handles everything.<br>
**Multi App Setup:** For larger projects where multiple services share one SuperTokens core.
- **Single App Example URL:** `BASE_URL = "<CORE_API_ENDPOINT>"`
- **Multi App Example URL:** `BASE_URL = "<CORE_API_ENDPOINT>/appid-task_service"`
*If you're managing several services, the multi-app setup keeps things organized.*

### üîê Step 4: Set Up the Authorization Service
This is where you tell your app how to handle OAuth2 tokens.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
import supertokens from "supertokens-node";
import OAuth2Provider from "supertokens-node/recipe/oauth2provider";

supertokens.init({
    supertokens: {
        connectionURI: "...",
        apiKey: "...",
    },
    appInfo: {
        appName: "...",
        apiDomain: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
      OAuth2Provider.init(),
    ]
});
```
This setup tells SuperTokens:
- Where to find your core server (connectionURI).
- The app‚Äôs name and domains.
- To include the OAuth2 provider.

### üîÑ Step 5: Generate Access Tokens

To generate a token, you send a POST request like this:

```javascript
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const response = await fetch("<YOUR_API_DOMAIN>/auth/oauth/token", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
    clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    grantType: "client_credentials",
    scope: ["event.create"],
    audience: "event"
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.accessToken);
```
**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "accessToken": "<TOKEN_VALUE>",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```
*The token is valid for **60 minutes**. After that, you'll need to request a new one.*

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Verify an Access Token
To confirm a token is valid:
**Code Example Using `jose`:**

```javascript
import jose from "jose";

const JWKS = jose.createRemoteJWKSet(new URL('<YOUR_API_DOMAIN>/auth/jwt/jwks.json'))

async function validateClientCredentialsToken(jwt) {
  const requiredScope = "event.create";
  const audience = "event";

  try {
    const { payload } = await jose.jwtVerify(jwt, JWKS, {
      audience,
      requiredClaims: ['stt', 'scp'],
    });

    if (payload.stt !== 1) return false;
    return payload.scp.includes(requiredScope);
  } catch (err) {
    return false;
  }
}
```
This checks:

stt (SuperTokens Token Type) ‚Äî Ensures it's an OAuth2 token.
scp (Scope) ‚Äî Confirms the token has the required permission.

### üåç Step 7: Example of Two Services Communicating Using M2M
Imagine you have two services:

- Task Service ‚Äî Creates tasks.
- Calendar Service ‚Äî Manages events.

**Flow:**
1. Task Service requests a token from the Authorization Server.
2. Using that token, Task Service makes a POST request to Calendar Service to create an event.

#### Step 1: Task Service Requests Token

```javascript
const tokenResponse = await fetch("<YOUR_API_DOMAIN>/auth/oauth/token", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    clientId: "task_service",
    clientSecret: "super_secret_value",
    grantType: "client_credentials",
    scope: ["event.create"],
    audience: "event"
  })
});

const { accessToken } = await tokenResponse.json();
```

#### Step 2: Task Service Sends Request to Calendar Service

```javascript
await fetch("https://calendar.example.com/events", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: "Team Meeting",
    date: "2025-03-25",
    location: "Conference Room A"
  })
});
```

#### Step 3: Calendar Service Verifies the Token

```javascript
app.post('/events', async (req, res) => {
  const token = req.headers['authorization']?.split('Bearer ')[1];

  if (!token) return res.status(401).send("Unauthorized");

  try {
    const valid = await validateClientCredentialsToken(token);
    if (!valid) return res.status(403).send("Forbidden");

    // Token is valid ‚Äî proceed with event creation
    res.status(201).send({ message: "Event created successfully!" });
  } catch {
    res.status(403).send("Invalid token");
  }
});
```

## üíª Building a Simple App with SuperTokens That Utilizes M2M Authentication üíª
The absolute best way to explain something technical is to give a real world example -- especially in code. So here you have it.

In this section we are going over how to build a sample application that includes two separate microservices that communicate with each other and need to authenticate one another before exchanging information. 

### Step 1: SuperTokens Setup 
In file `supertokensSetup.js` -- **This file initializes SuperTokens to manage authentication.**
- `supertokens.init()`
    - `connectionURI`: Points to the SuperTokens core instance (hosted at `https://try.supertokens.com` for this example)
    - `appInfo`: Defines key details for your app like API and website domains
    - `recipeList`: Specifies that we're using **Session Management** for token handling. 
SuperTokens handles the logic for issuing, verifying, and refreshing tokens behind the scenes.

```javascript
import supertokens from 'supertokens-node';
import Session from 'supertokens-node/recipe/session';

supertokens.init({
    framework: 'express',
    supertokens: { connectionURI: 'https://try.supertokens.com'},
    appInfo: {
        appName: 'M2M Example', 
        apiDomain: 'http://localhost:3000',
        websiteDomain: 'http://localhost:3000'
    },
    recipeList: [Session.init()]
    });
```

### Step 2: Inventory Management API 
in file `inventoryApi.js` -- **This service exposes the `/check-stock` endpoint.**
- `inventoryApp.use(middleware())`: Adds SuperTokens' middleware to manage incoming session tokens. [We have an incoming article we can link to here!]
- `inventoryApp.get('/check-stock')`: This endpoint checks stock for a product.
    - `Session.verifySession()`: Ensures the request includes a valid M2M token before responding.
- `inventoryApp.use(errorHandler())`: Handles authentication errors gracefully.

This file ensures only authorized services can query stock data.

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { middleware, errorHandler } from 'supertokens-node/framework/express';
import Session from 'supertokens-node/recipe/session';

const inventoryApp = express();
inventoryApp.use(middleware());

inventoryApp.get('/check-stock', Session.verifySession(), (req, res) => {
    res.json({ item: 'Magic Sword', stock: 12 });
});

inventoryApp.use(errorHandler());
inventoryApp.listen(3001, () => console.log('Inventory API running on port 3001'));
```

### Step 3: Order Processing API 
in file `OrderApi.js` -‚Äî **This service exposes the `/process-order` endpoint.**
- `getAuthToken():`
    - Uses `Session.createNewSessionViaToken()` to generate a session token for the Order API.
    - The returned token is sent as a **Bearer Token** in requests.
- `orderApp.post('/process-order')`:
    - Calls `getAuthToken()` to request an access token.
    - Uses `axios` to send a **GET** request to `/check-stock` with the token in the `Authorization` header.
    - If successful, the response confirms the stock check and completes the order.
- **Error Handling**: Any issues with token creation or the `/check-stock` call are captured and returned as a `500` error.

This file ensures that the Order Processing API authenticates itself before querying the Inventory Management API.

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import axios from 'axios';
import Session from 'supertokens-node/recipe/session';
import { middleware, errorHandler } from 'supertokens-node/framework/express';

const orderApp = express();
orderApp.use(express.json());
orderApp.use(middleware());

orderApp.post('/process-order', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const token = await Session.createNewSession(req, 'order-api');
        const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/check-stock', {
            headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token.getAccessToken()}` },
        });
        res.json({ message: 'Order processed successfully', stockData: response.data });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Stock check failed', details: error.message });
    }
});

orderApp.use(errorHandler());
orderApp.listen(3000, () => console.log('Order API running on port 3000'));
```

### Step 4: Running the Project
1. Install Dependencies
```bash 
npm install express supertokens-node axios
```
2. Start SuperTokens Core
```bash
npx supertokens start
```

3. Start the Inventory Management API
```bash
node inventoryApi.js
```

4. Start the Order Processing API

```bash 
node orderApi.js
```

5. Test the Flow

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/process-order
```
**How the Authentication Flow Works**
1. The Order Processing API requests a token from SuperTokens using getAuthToken().
2. The token is included in the request headers when calling the Inventory Management API.
3. The Inventory Management API verifies the token using Session.verifySession().
4. If valid, the inventory data is returned; otherwise, the request is rejected.

## Conclusion 

**Machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication** is a method that enables secure communication between services without human intervention. Unlike traditional user authentication, where a person logs in, M2M authentication relies on tokens or keys that one service presents to another to prove its identity.

This approach is crucial for scenarios like:
- ‚úÖ Microservices architectures where services need to exchange data securely.
- ‚úÖ Automated systems such as order processing, data synchronization, or scheduled tasks.
- ‚úÖ API integrations where external services must connect safely.

By implementing M2M authentication, you ensure that your services can trust one another, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and improving overall system security.

We also walked through **implementing a simple yet effective machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication flow using SuperTokens**. By setting up two services ‚Äî an Inventory Management API and an Order Processing API ‚Äî we demonstrated how to:
- ‚úÖ Initialize SuperTokens for secure session management.
- ‚úÖ Protect endpoints with Session.verifySession() to ensure only authorized requests are processed.
- ‚úÖ Generate and use tokens for secure communication between services.

This setup offers a lightweight yet powerful way to handle M2M authentication, ensuring data integrity and security when your services need to talk to each other. Whether you're building microservices, third-party integrations, or internal APIs, this pattern provides a strong foundation to build on.
