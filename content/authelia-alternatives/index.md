## Introduction

Authentication servers form the backbone of modern application security and developers are looking for strong and flexible options that offer more than just simple password protection. Authelia is a good choice, but many organizations are checking out other options that might fit their needs better, whether that means having more features, different pricing plans, or easier integrations.

According to recent[ security statistics from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach), compromised credentials remain the most common attack vector for data breaches, accounting for nearly [16% of all incidents](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/7-key-takeaways-ibm-s-cost-data-breach-report-2024#:~:text=Notable%20stats%3A%C2%A0Credential%2Dbased%20attacks%20were%20the%20most%20common%20attack%20vector%2C%20accounting%20for%C2%A016%25%20of%20all%20breaches.). This underscores the critical importance of choosing the right authentication solution for your organization.

In this blog, we're going to look at the top 7 alternatives to Authelia. Each one has its own strengths and is designed to meet different needs for security, scalability, and ease of use. Whether you're a startup looking for a simple solution that works well for developers or a large company with complex identity and access management needs, you'll find plenty of choices for secure authentication. We’ll go over the main features, pricing, pros and cons of each option to help you decide what’s best for your authentication strategy.
