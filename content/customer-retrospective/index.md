**Experience with Setting Up and Integrating SuperTokens**:
- **Seamless Integration**: They seamlessly added SuperTokens to their codebase in just a single week.
- **Smooth Transition**: They were able to gradually transition users over the course of a month with minimal disruption to their services.

**How SuperTokens Helped**:
