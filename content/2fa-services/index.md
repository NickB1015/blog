Let's talk about two-factor authentication (2FA) - what it is, why it's important, and why you probably need to use it. Sure, it's a sometimes annoying extra step your users *may* complain about. Still, it's a small price to pay for the security it provides - not to mention it's exactly what stands between their accounts and the proverbial "script kiddies" with too much time on their hands, professional hackers, and other malicious actors.

The problem, though, is that, as with many things in software development, we're spoiled for choice. And the experience of picking one can be as fun as debugging regex. I don't imagine many of us enjoy comparing pages upon pages of features, pricing, and other details. You've got costs that scale faster than that infinite loop AWS lambda you forgot about, integration headaches that make the OAuth RFC look like a light weekend read, and user experiences ranging from ü§∑ to "Why do you hate me?"

Still with me? Cool. Let's fix that by having a look at some options out there.

## 1. SuperTokens: Simplified 2FA for Developers

There's a gradient between "build auth yourself" (and potentially introduce various footguns), and "go bankrupt and use BigAuth". SuperTokens lies in the middle - you can self-host it, put it up on a cloud provider of your choice, go managed (without us doing the cost-magically-increases rug pull), mix and match, and/or migrate as the need arises. 

Why it might work for you:

- Pre-built UI that doesn't look like it's from cca 2010. It's also fully customizable.
- Multi-tenant support that works as advertised.
- TOTP support, for when you absolutely and positively must use Google Authenticator.
- No charges for dev licenses - which is an article unto itself considering the offering out there, and best left for another time.
- Easily integrates with a plethora of backend and frontend frameworks out there.

More importantly to 2FA, SuperTokens comes with OTP via SMS and email. The best part? You won‚Äôt need a PhD in cryptography to implement it. Plus, the pricing won‚Äôt make your CFO faint - it's $0.01 / MAU  for the managed version (with a minimum charge of $100).

## 2. Duo Security

Suppose enterprise is more your jam, and you‚Äôre looking for something that scales well and comes with enterprise features without the enterprise complexity. In that case, Duo Security (now a part of Cisco) might be the answer you're looking for. 

Why it might work for you:

- Clean, modern UI.
- Strong focus on large organizations with an enteprise-grade 2FA.
- Push notifications, SMS, and biometric verification
- Free tier (up to 10 users); Pricing starts at $3 per user per month on the Essentials plan.

While it makes a lot of sense to use Duo for enterprise-grade 2FA, it might be a bit too much for smaller organizations. 

## 3. Okta Adaptive MFA

Continuing with the enterprise theme, Okta Adaptive MFA is a great choice for organizations that need to support a wide range of devices and users. It is a bit on the pricier side (6$ per user per month), but if the feature set it offers is what you need, it's a solid option.

Note: Okta comes with a regular MFA offering, too, priced at $3 per user per month.

Why it might work for you:

- Phishing-resistant by design (WebAuthn, Smart Cards, FastPass)
- Context-aware authentication that actually works
- Proactive threat detection via ThreatInsight
- Device security checks

While investing in your security is a worthwhile endeavor, there may be cheaper options out there (that work just as well).

## 4. Yubico (YubiKey as a Service)

If managing hardware security keys sounds about as fun as a root canal, Yubico‚Äôs got something interesting cooking. Think of it as ‚ÄúYubiKey as a Service‚Äù - all the security of hardware keys, but with the flexibility of a subscription service.

Why it might work for you:

- Phishing-resistant security for less than your daily coffee habit (a direct quote)
- Mix and match form factors (USB-A, USB-C, NFC) without the commitment issues
- Up to 25% yearly key replacements included (because stuff happens)
- 75% drop in password-related support tickets (your IT team will love you)

Yubico (specifically YubiKey as a service) is a great fit for organizations of a certain size that require a hardware key solution. 

## Comparing 2FA Services: What Matters Most to Developers?

Let‚Äôs cut through the marketing speak and look at what actually matters when picking a 2FA solution. Because let‚Äôs face it - you probably care more about integration headaches and pricing surprises than fancy buzzwords.

| Service | Pricing | Features |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| SuperTokens | $0.01/MAU (min $100) managed, free self-hosted | Pre-built UI, Multi-tenant, TOTP, SMS, Email OTP |
| Duo Security | Free up to 10 users, then $3/user/month | Push notifications, SMS, Biometric verification, Enterprise features |
| Okta Adaptive MFA | $6/user/month | Phishing-resistant (WebAuthn, Smart Cards), Context-aware auth, Threat detection, Device security |
| YubiKey as a Service | $3.94/user/month (starting, see calculator for details) | Phishing-resistant hardware keys, Mix and match form factors, Key replacements, Dedicated support, Global distribution |

Here‚Äôs the TL;DR on our contenders:

SuperTokens is your ‚ÄúI just want this to work without going bankrupt‚Äù option:

- $0.01/MAU (minimum $100) for managed version
- Self-hosting available (free, open source)
- Pre-built UI that doesn‚Äôt make users cry
- Multi-tenant that actually works
- TOTP, SMS, email OTP out of the box

Duo sits in the ‚Äúenterprise but make it digestible‚Äù camp:

- Free for up to 10 users
- $3/user/month after that
- Push notifications that users actually use
- Biometric verification
- Clean UI (seriously, it‚Äôs pretty nice)

Okta Adaptive MFA is the ‚Äúwe have money and security needs‚Äù choice:

- $6/user/month (ouch, but maybe worth it?). Note: Okta comes with a regular MFA offering, too, priced at $3 per user per month.
- Phishing-resistant by design
- Context-aware authentication
- Threat detection that works
- Device security checks

YubiKey as a Service takes the ‚Äúhardware keys without the hardware headaches‚Äù approach:

- Subscription-based hardware key service
- Mix and match form factors
- Replacement keys included
- Global distribution (yes, even to that office)


## Why SuperTokens is a Great Fit for Developers

Without going into every feature SuperTokens has, but here‚Äôs what you actually care about:

- It won‚Äôt bankrupt you. Most of it is free anyway.
- You can self-host it if you‚Äôre experimenting, looking to fully own your stack, or just want to save a few bucks
- The UI is customizable enough to make it look like Windows 98, if you're into that
- Integration won‚Äôt make you question your career choices. Chances are, we support your framework.
- We care a lot about developer experience and getting started right. In fact, we have a [whole CLI dedicated to both scaffolding and getting educated](https://github.com/supertokens/create-supertokens-app) on how SuperTokens works, before you decide to commit. Give it a spin by running `npx create-supertokens-app` in your terminal.

## Conclusion

2FA isn‚Äôt just a nice-to-have anymore - it‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äúwe got hacked‚Äù and ‚Äúnice try, script kiddies.‚Äù Whether you go with SuperTokens for its developer-friendly approach, Duo for its enterprise features, Okta for its adaptive security, or YubiKey for hardware-based protection, the important thing is that you‚Äôre implementing 2FA.

Pick the solution that matches your needs and budget, but whatever you do, don‚Äôt skip adding 2FA. Your users‚Äô security (and your sleep schedule) will thank you.
