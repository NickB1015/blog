## Feature Comparison: Okta vs OneLogin

### User Experience
- **Okta:** Renowned for its intuitive interface and seamless user experience. One thing to note though is that if you are still shopping around it can be difficult to get to know the platform unless you sign up for a free trial (by providing your email) or watch a short webinar about the platform (by providing your email as well). Ideally you should be able to get to know their platform without providing your contact information so that you can make a good decision without having to sign up for updates you may not want. 
- **OneLogin:** Praised for its user-friendly design and straightforward navigation.

### Integration Capabilities

Both Okta and OneLogin provide extensive pre-built integrations. Based on their websites, **Okta provides over 7,000** and **OneLogin provides over 6,000 pre built integrations**. Both provide integrations for all the major technologies your company may use so you wouldn't go wrong with either choice if integration choices are your concern. 

### Security Measures
- **Okta:** Employs adaptive security policies and AI-driven risk assessment to enhance protection.
- **OneLogin:** Utilizes SmartFactor Authentication and role-based access control to ensure secure access.

### Pricing Structure
- **Okta:** Utilizes a per-user pricing model with modular add-ons, which can become costly as features are added. Okta Platform -- the IAM solution by Okta -- has 4 pricing structures as of writing of this article. They are Starter, Essentials, Professional, and Enterprise. The cheapest one, Starter, will set you back $6 per user/month and includes Universal Directory, Workflows (only 5 flows), SSO, and MFA. If you want to add Adaptive MFA or even Lifecycle management, access governance or privileged access you will be set back $17 per user per month. Anything after that you need to inquire for pricing, which doesn't bode well for people who want more transparent pricing. Their Identity Threat Protection is only included in the Professional suite package, which you need to call for pricing. This is unfortunate because as cyber threats continue to grow having a feature like session hijacking protection is not a nice to have, but a must have. You must also meet a minimum of $1500 annual contraxt for any of the suites. 
- **OneLogin:** Offers competitive pricing with comprehensive features included, making it attractive for budget-conscious organizations.
