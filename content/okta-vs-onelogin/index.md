## Feature Comparison: Okta vs OneLogin

### User Experience
- **Okta:** Renowned for its intuitive interface and seamless user experience. One thing to note though is that if you are still shopping around it can be difficult to get to know the platform unless you sign up for a free trial (by providing your email) or watch a short webinar about the platform (by providing your email as well). Ideally you should be able to get to know their platform without providing your contact information so that you can make a good decision without having to sign up for updates you may not want. 
- **OneLogin:** Praised for its user-friendly design and straightforward navigation.

### Integration Capabilities

Both Okta and OneLogin provide extensive pre-built integrations. Based on their websites, **Okta provides over 7,000** and **OneLogin provides over 6,000 pre built integrations**. Both provide integrations for all the major technologies your company may use so you wouldn't go wrong with either choice if integration choices are your concern. 

### Security Measures
- **Okta:** Employs adaptive security policies and AI-driven risk assessment to enhance protection.
- **OneLogin:** Utilizes SmartFactor Authentication and role-based access control to ensure secure access.

### Pricing Structure

#### Okta Pricing

![alt text](image.png)
[**Okta’s pricing**](https://www.okta.com/pricing/) is based on a **per-user model with extra costs for additional features** — and those costs can add up fast. Their IAM platform has four pricing tiers: **Starter**, **Essentials**, **Professional**, and **Enterprise**.
- The **Starter plan** is the most affordable at **$6 per user/month**. It includes basics like Universal Directory, Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and up to five Workflows.
- If you need features like Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Access Governance, or Privileged Access, you’ll be looking at **$17 per user/month.**
- For anything beyond that, you’ll need to reach out to Okta for pricing.

**Regarding which one you choose, all plans are billed annually so it would potentially require a substantial upfront cost.**

**Lastly, all plans require a minimum annual contract of $1,500, which could be a hurdle for smaller teams or companies just getting started, but seem fair and doable for larger or enterprise companies.**

#### OneLogin Pricing

[**OneLogin’s pricing**](https://www.onelogin.com/product/pricing) also follows a **per-user model** with feature-based tiers, and it’s often seen as more budget-friendly than some competitors. OneLogin offers three main plans: **Starter**, **Advanced**, and **Professional**.
- The **Starter plan** begins at **$4 per user/month** and includes essentials like Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and basic reporting.
- For more **advanced security features** like Adaptive MFA, SmartFactor Authentication, and policy enforcement, you'll need the Advanced plan, which starts at **$8 per user/month**.
- The **Professional plan** offers enhanced capabilities like Lifecycle Management and advanced reporting, but **pricing requires contacting OneLogin directly**.

Similar to Okta, all OneLogin plans are billed annually, which may require a larger upfront investment.

**Unlike Okta, OneLogin doesn’t have a mandatory minimum contract, which may make it a better fit for smaller teams or those exploring IAM solutions for the first time.**
