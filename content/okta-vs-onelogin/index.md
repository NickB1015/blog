## Introduction to Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Identity and Access Management (IAM**) is all about making sure the right people have access to the right stuff and that the wrong people don’t. It helps you as a business keep your data, systems, and apps secure by confirming who’s trying to log in and what they’re allowed to do. A good IAM solution not only boosts security but also makes it easier to manage your user accounts, especially as you grow and rely more on cloud services.

Both Okta and OneLogin offer a solid set of features for identity and access management, but there are some differences: 
- **Okta:** Provides a wide range of features like Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Lifecycle Management, and Adaptive Security Policies. However, some advanced features — like Identity Threat Protection — are only available in higher-tier plans.
- **OneLogin:** Offers similar core features, including SSO, MFA, and Lifecycle Management. One standout feature is **SmartFactor Authentication**, which uses AI to assess risk in real-time and adapt security measures accordingly.

**While both platforms cover the basics well, Okta leans heavily on modular add-ons, while OneLogin provides some advanced features at lower price points.**

### User Experience
Both Okta and OneLogin offer intuitive and user-friendly experiences.  
- **Okta** stands out with its **End-User Dashboard** and **Browser Plugin**, which boost productivity with **customizable layouts**, **enhanced search**, and **onboarding guides**.

Both provide integrations for all the major technologies your company may use so you wouldn't go wrong with either choice if integration choices are your concern. 

### Security Measures
**Both Okta and OneLogin offer strong security features, but they take slightly different approaches:**

- **Okta** uses **adaptive security policies** and [**AI-driven risk assessment**](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/itp/overview.htm) to detect and respond to potential threats in real-time. 
- **OneLogin** relies on [**SmartFactor Authentication**](https://www.onelogin.com/product/smartfactor-authentication) and **role-based access control** to ensure users only access what they’re supposed to.

Both provide solid protection, but the right choice may depend on your team's specific security needs.

### Pricing Structure
#### Okta Pricing

![alt text](image.png)
[**Okta’s pricing**](https://www.okta.com/pricing/) is based on a **per-user model with extra costs for additional features** — and those costs can add up fast. Their IAM platform has four pricing tiers: **Starter**, **Essentials**, **Professional**, and **Enterprise**.
- The **Starter plan** is the most affordable at **$6 per user/month**. It includes basics like Universal Directory, Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and up to five Workflows.
- If you need features like Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Access Governance, or Privileged Access, you’ll be looking at **$17 per user/month.**
- For anything beyond that, you’ll need to reach out to Okta for pricing.

**Regarding which one you choose, all plans are billed annually so it would potentially require a substantial upfront cost.**

**Lastly, all plans require a minimum annual contract of $1,500, which could be a hurdle for smaller teams or companies just getting started, but seem fair and doable for larger or enterprise companies.**

#### OneLogin Pricing

![alt text](image-1.png)
[**OneLogin’s pricing**](https://www.onelogin.com/product/pricing) also follows a **per-user model** with feature-based tiers, and it’s often seen as more budget-friendly than some competitors. OneLogin offers three main plans: **Starter**, **Advanced**, and **Professional**.
- The **Starter plan** begins at **$4 per user/month** and includes essentials like Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and basic reporting.
- For more **advanced security features** like Adaptive MFA, SmartFactor Authentication, and policy enforcement, you'll need the Advanced plan, which starts at **$8 per user/month**.
- The **Professional plan** offers enhanced capabilities like Lifecycle Management and advanced reporting, but **pricing requires contacting OneLogin directly**.

Similar to Okta, all OneLogin plans are billed annually, which may require a larger upfront investment.

**Unlike Okta, OneLogin doesn’t have a mandatory minimum contract, which may make it a better fit for smaller teams or those exploring IAM solutions for the first time.**
