## What Is An Enumeration Attack? 

An **enumeration attack** is a broad term for an attack that tries to uncover information by trying different inputs and seeing which are valid. 

For authentication purposes an enumeration attack happens when a hacker tries different inputs to uncover information like valid usernames, emails, or passwords to help bypass authentication defenses, like your users' login screens. 

**Why "help" instead of just "bypass"?**

**That's because these attacks focus on gathering information.** Even discovering a valid username (and not the password as well) is a success, as it can lead to other attacks that break through your authentication, like [password cracking](https://supertokens.com/blog/password-cracking-and-how-to-protect-against-them). 

If you don't have the right defense mechanisms in place, enumeration attacks will find an exploit and take over your users' accounts. But fear not! This guide will reveal seven cheat codes hackers use to exploit enumeration vulnerabilities and, more importantly, how you can counter them. 

## How Login Enumeration Attacks Work

When a hacker navigates to your login screen they will enter an arbitrary username and password combination. After that they will typically get one of three outcomes: 
1. **They will get a message that the username does not exist.** (Let's them know the user doesn't exist and they can stop wasting their time and try a different one)
2. **They will get a message saying the password is incorrect.** (Let's them know the password is incorrect the username is!)
3. **They will successfully log in.** (Well, that's self explanatory 😂)

Common enumeration attacks that are covered in the article are: 
1. Exploiting Login Error Messages 🚨
2. Manipulating Password Reset Forms 🔑
3. Abusing Registration Forms 👤
4. Scraping API Responses 🛠️
5. Timing Attacks: The Millisecond Giveaway ⏳
6. Abusing Forgot Username Features 🤔
7. Using Social Engineering and Data Leaks 💀

## Exploiting Login Error Messages 🚨

When an app encounters an error it often generates an error message to provide feedback to users or developers.

Often we hear that descriptive error messages are super important for debugging, to know what went wrong. Or to users to give them information about what went wrong. But when done wrong it can be exploited by hackers to find information they can exploit to get into a system and steal sensitive data.

But it's important to craft those messages in a way that does not reveal any personal information like database connection strings, usernames/emails, passwords, or session tokens. Even suggesting whether a username or a password is correct can be a hint that can be exploited. 

**Don't: Password is incorrect.**
Why it's bad: This message suggests that the password is incorrect, but it can also mean that the username is correct, so now hackers can add this username to a list of correct usernames and try different passwords to hack into this account. 

**Do: Password or username is incorrect.**
Why it's better: This doesn't suggest if the username/email or password is correct. So the hacker doesn't have any additional information about the user. 

Sometimes the errors can expose what the backend runs on, what version of a specific software it uses which can itself have vulnerabilities that can be exploited. 

Even something like `This username does not exist` can give a hint about which usernames do exist because hackers may continue trying until they find usernames that do exist. 

These attacks are also often automated so they don't even have to be there manually typing out different usernames. 

### How To Shut It Down 
- Ensure that the production applications are not revealing developmental errors. Typically, these settings are in the configuration file of whatever framework you use. 
- Avoid displaying detailed error messages to users or developers. 
- Implement proper error-handling mechanisms that do not reveal sensitive information. 
- Implement Timeouts after certain number of wrong login attempts. This works especially great for automated hacking like scripts. 
- Monitor failed login attempts. Unusual spikes could indicate an enumeration attack. 

## Manipulating Password Reset Forms 🔑

### How Hackers Do It
- They enter random emails into password reset forms. 
- If the system responds with "A reset link has been sent," the hackers know the email is valid. 

### How To Shut It Down
- Use a neutral response. Something like "If this email is registered, you will receive a reset link" is much more secure than "A reset link has been sent." 


## How SuperTokens Stops Enumeration Attacks and Protects Your Users 
SuperTokens is built with security-first authentication, **preventing enumeration vulnerabilities by default**.

- **Generic error messages**: Attackers can’t tell if a username exists or not.
- **Secure session management**: Prevents token theft and session hijacking.
- **MFA and passwordless authentication**: Removes reliance on weak passwords.
- **Rate limiting and bot protection**: Automatically blocks suspicious login attempts.
