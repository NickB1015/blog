## What Is An Enumeration Attack? 

An **enumeration attack** is a broad term for an attack that tries to uncover information by trying different inputs and seeing which are valid. 

For authentication purposes an enumeration attack happens when a hacker tries different inputs to uncover information like valid usernames, emails, or passwords to help bypass authentication defenses, like your users' login screens. 

**Why "help" instead of just "bypass"?**

**That's because these attacks focus on gathering information.** Even just discovering a valid username (and not the password to go with it) is a success, as it can lead to other attacks that break through your authentication, like [password cracking](https://supertokens.com/blog/password-cracking-and-how-to-protect-against-them). 

If you don't have the right defense mechanisms in place, enumeration attacks will find an exploit and take over your users' accounts. But fear not! This guide will reveal seven cheat codes hackers use to exploit enumeration vulnerabilities and, more importantly, how you can counter them. 

## How Login Enumeration Attacks Work

When a hacker navigates to your login screen they will enter an arbitrary username and password combination. After that they will typically get one of three outcomes: 
1. **They will get a message that the username does not exist.** (Let's them know the user doesn't exist and they can stop wasting their time and try a different one)
2. **They will get a message saying the password is incorrect.** (Let's them know the password is incorrect but the username is!)
3. **They will successfully log in.** (Well, that's self explanatory 😂)

Common enumeration attacks that are covered in the article are: 
1. Exploiting Login Error Messages 🚨
2. Manipulating Password Reset Forms 🔑
3. Abusing Registration Forms 👤
4. Scraping API Responses 🛠️
5. Timing Attacks: The Millisecond Giveaway ⏳
6. Abusing Forgot Username Features 🤔
7. Using Social Engineering and Data Leaks 💀

## Exploiting Login Error Messages 🚨

When an app encounters an error, it typically generates a message to inform users or developers about what went wrong. 

Descriptive error messages are crucial for debugging and user feedback. However, poorly designed messages can be exploited by hackers to gather information that helps them break into a system and steal sensitive data. 

To prevent this, error messages should never expose personal details like database connection strings, usernames, emails, passwords, or session tokens. Even revealing whether a username or password is correct (or incorrect) can provide attackers with valuable clues. 

🚫 **Don't**: "Password is incorrect." <br>
🔴 **Why it’s bad**: This confirms the username exists, allowing hackers to compile a list of valid usernames and try different passwords.

✅ **Do**: "Username or password is incorrect."<br>
🟢 **Why it’s better**: This prevents attackers from knowing which part is wrong, reducing the risk of targeted guessing.

Additionally, error messages should avoid exposing backend technologies or software versions, as outdated or vulnerable components can become attack vectors.

Even a simple message like "This username does not exist" can be dangerous, as attackers can repeatedly test different usernames to discover valid ones. These attacks are often automated, making them even more effective.

By carefully crafting error messages, developers can improve security while still providing useful feedback.

### How To Shut It Down 
To minimize security risks, follow these best practices:

✅ **Hide development errors in production.** Check your framework’s configuration to ensure that users don’t see detailed error logs.

✅ **Limit the information shown in error messages.** Keep them vague enough to avoid exposing sensitive details.

✅ **Implement proper error handling.** Prevent backend errors from leaking system details.

✅ **Set login attempt limits.** Add timeouts or account lockouts after multiple failed attempts—this is especially effective against automated attacks.

✅ **Monitor failed logins.** Sudden spikes in failed attempts could indicate a brute-force or enumeration attack.

By following these steps, you can keep error messages useful for users while preventing hackers from exploiting them.

## Manipulating Password Reset Forms 🔑

### How Hackers Do It
- They enter random emails into password reset forms. 
- If the system responds with "A reset link has been sent," the hackers know the email is valid. 

### How To Shut It Down
- Use a neutral response. Something like "If this email is registered, you will receive a reset link" is much more secure than "A reset link has been sent." 


## How SuperTokens Stops Enumeration Attacks and Protects Your Users 
SuperTokens is built with security-first authentication, **preventing enumeration vulnerabilities by default**.

- **Generic error messages**: Attackers can’t tell if a username exists or not.
- **Secure session management**: Prevents token theft and session hijacking.
- **MFA and passwordless authentication**: Removes reliance on weak passwords.
- **Rate limiting and bot protection**: Automatically blocks suspicious login attempts.
