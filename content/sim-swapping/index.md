Cybercriminals sure know how to keep themselves busy. One scam they just can't seem to get enough of is **SIM swapping** â€” a sneaky trick where they hijack your SIM card and take over your phone number. So any calls or texts you receive go to them, not to you. 

Understanding how SIM swapping works â€” and how to prevent it â€” is essential to keeping your user accounts and personal data safe. 

After all, scammers donâ€™t just hack your phone â€” they pose as you to fool your mobile provider and gain access to your most important accounts. Incredibly rude if you ask  me. ðŸ˜‘

Time to spot the faker and kick them to the curb.

## What Is a SIM Card? 
A **SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)** is a small card that **connects your phone to your mobile network**. ðŸ“¶ðŸ“²

It holds important details such as your phone number, contacts, and other data. This information allows you to make calls, send texts, and use mobile data. It's removable and transferable to other phones.

Alternatively, **eSIM cards are embedded Subscriber Identity Modules** -- SIM cards that are built into a user's phone. ðŸ”’ðŸ“²

**Because the SIM is tied to your account, moving it to another phone will transfer your mobile services to that device.**

In a SIM-swapping attack, cybercriminals exploit this by tricking your carrier into switching your phone number to a SIM they control, giving them access to your accounts and personal data. 

## What Is SIM Swapping and Why You Should Care? 

**SIM Swapping** (SIM hijacking or port-out fraud) is a fraud technique where scammers transfer a victim's phone number to a new SIM card under their control. It's a type of account takeover. 
 
**This allows scammers -- our cybervillains -- to receive communications associated with your phone number, including those that let them to access your social media profiles, banking and other accounts.**

Cybervillains may target people who have valuable social media or financial accounts. This is how Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, got his account hacked in 2019. 

## How It Works 

1. **Typically, a SIM attack begins with the attacker gathering personal information about users.** This information is used in verifying a person's identity and an attacker can use it to impersonate you. They could find details about you from: 
- your social media accounts
- private information that has been leaked 
- any information about you that is freely online

2. **The attacker will then reach out to your phone company pretending to be you.** They can use any information they have on you to answer security questions -- which is why some people also question the safety of personal questions as a security measure. Then they will ask to have your phone number transferred to a SIM card they control. 

3. **After all this, attackers will now have access to your text messages and contacts.** This could also lead to even more attacks because once they have this information, attackers can get even more information on users, including passwords and emails.

## Are eSIM Cards More Secure Than Physical SIM Cards? 

##  Why SMS 2FA Is No Longer Enough

##  The Right Authentication Strategy: Moving Beyond SMS 2FA

Implement these three pillars to make sure you and your users are safe.

#### Pillar 1 -- Implement Stronger Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Alternatives
- **FIDO2/WebAuthn Authentication**: Device-based authentication eliminates reliance on SMS.
- **TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Passwords) with an Authenticator App**:
- Apps like **Google Authenticator** and **Authy** remove carrier dependence.
- Attackers need physical access to the userâ€™s device to generate 2FA codes.

#### Pillar 2 -- Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for High-Risk Actions
- Enforce **MFA for sensitive transactions** (password changes, fund transfers, adding new devices).
- Use **risk-based authentication** to prompt extra verification only when login behavior seems suspicious.

#### Pillar 3 -- Implement Robust Session Management
- **Limit session lifetimes**: Prevent long-lived sessions from being exploited.
- **Auto-log out users when a phone number or device change is detected**.
- **Use SuperTokens to handle secure, scalable session management.**

## How SuperTokens Helps Secure Authentication Against SIM Swaps

## Final Thoughts: Secure Your Authentication System Before Itâ€™s Too Late
Unfortunately, businesses can no longer rely on SMS-based authentication to protect user accounts. SWIM swapping is an industry-wide problem, but SuperTokens provides the authentication tools to stop account takeover before they happen. 

Next step is to migrate your authentication system to a modern and secure CIAM solution that keeps customer accounts safe at scale.
